There are 2 jupyter notebooks namely build_cnn.ipynb and image_filtering.ipynb. To run them,
1. simply download the notebooks to your machine
2. Run jupyter notebook (macOS command for terminal: jupyter notebook), notebooks browser will open automatically on your default browser. If it does not open automatically check the terminal output dump for the URL.
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved the notebooks and open.
4. Now run each cell step by step
5. You will nee python version 3.12 

NOTE: There are 2 version of build_CNN. build_cnn.ipynb was the version I accidently pushed it only contains implementation of model and runs it whereas the latest correct version build_cnn_2.ipynb it contains compplete model and visual representation.
