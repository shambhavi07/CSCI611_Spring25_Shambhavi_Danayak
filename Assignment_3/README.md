## How To Run this project

This project contains multiple large files which creates issues when uploading to GitHub (max limit for each file is 25MB). Below are some notes that will help run my notebook,

**NOTE**: This assignment is completed using university provided A100 server.  
To run it on server you access the cscigpu account (`ssh yourusername@cscigpu.csuchico.edu`) -> run jupyter notebook (install if required) (`pip install Jupyter notebook`) -> port forward to your localhost to be able to run the notebook on your browser (`ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 yourusername@cscigpu.csuchico.edu`).

### **1. Folders:**   
***'runs/', 'runs_Data_aug_scale/', 'runs_Data_aug_scale_withAnchorBoxTuning/', 'runs_high_Reso/'***   
contains results from various model runs with varying data augmentation, NMS, confidence score etc. Once you run my notebook (A3.ipynb) same results will be generated. You can edit the folder name/results (in the code block of Jupyter notebook) files etc. as per you directory.
   
### **2. The full completed notebook:**  
***Google Drive link:*** [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lfc8vh3JuTNYlUjFIQdPriJc7ZvSeb2M?usp=sharing]

The full notebook is uploaded on Google Drive and access has been provided to you professor (bshen2@csuchico.edu).   In the drive you will find A3.ipynb (implementaion of Assignment 3) and dataset.zip downloaded from roboflow (when you run the notebook there is a codeblock that extracts the dataset and saves it as roboflow_data). 
I have also added the model file (yolov8n.pt) this file is also available here on GitHub. 
The drive also contains the sample test video downloaded from course shared drive 'GX011159.MP4' this video is used to generate inference.
The folder Test_images_videos contains all the inference results created when the trained model is ran on test video and test images. 

### **3. PR_Curves.ipynb:**  
This I have uploaded on GitHub, this notebook contains the PR_Curves generated by the model. They can also be found in the runs folders ('runs/detect/train', 'runs_Data_aug_scale', 'runs_Data_aug_scale_withAnchorBoxTuning', 'runs_high_Reso')

### **4. File 'A3_Small Object Detection Report.pdf':**  
contains the Submission Report 
   
### **5. File 'ScreenshotProofForRunningJupyterNotebook.pdf':**   
Contains Screenshots of how my code is successfully executed and generating required outputs, graphs and tables etc.

### **6. File 'sample_image.jpg' and 'sample_image_2.jpg'**  
sample test images used to draw inference
