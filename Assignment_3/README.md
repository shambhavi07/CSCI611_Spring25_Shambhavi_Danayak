This project contains multiple large files which creates issues when uploading to GitHub (max limit for each file is 25MB). Below are some notes that will help run my notebook,

1. Folders: 'runs/detect/train', 'runs_Data_aug_scale', 'runs_Data_aug_scale_withAnchorBoxTuning', 'runs_high_Reso' contains results from various model runs with varying data augmentation, NMS, confidence score etc. Once ou run my notebook (A3.ipynb) same results will be generated. you can edit the folder name/results files etc. as per you directory.
2. The full completed notebook: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lfc8vh3JuTNYlUjFIQdPriJc7ZvSeb2M?usp=sharing]
